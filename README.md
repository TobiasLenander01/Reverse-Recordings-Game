# Reverse-Recordings-Game

This is a two player game written in C# based on recording words then guessing the correct one after hearing a reversed recording of it. The waveRecorder class handles recording, reversing and playing wave files using the open source Naudio (and soundTouch) library written by Mark Heath. The reversing method uses a library by David Klempfner called WaveFileManipulator.
